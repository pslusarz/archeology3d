## Visualize large codebases

How do you make sense of a software ecosystem with 1000 classes? 10,000? 50,000? I am experimenting with various ways of visualizing, exploring and finding patterns in large codebases. For more background, check out these posts ([1](http://10kftcode.blogspot.com/2013/06/3-quick-metrics-to-understand-large.html), [2](http://10kftcode.blogspot.com/2013/04/groovy-and-java-class-sizes-in-practice.html)) and my Strange Loop 2013 [presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1drGSbii7uXMhu9rZx87prvczy-TwxM7zHZAbo7McDbI). 

This application isn't ready for others to use, but if you want to try it out, it runs on the latest JMonkey with Groovy plugin. I also had success running it on IntelliJ.
